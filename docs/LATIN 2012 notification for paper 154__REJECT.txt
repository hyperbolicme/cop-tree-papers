Dear author,

The review process for LATIN 2012 has been a delicate and challenging task for the committee.  Each 
paper was carefully evaluated by at least three referees; in most cases, there were at least four.  After 
the reviews were turned in, a vigorous discussion ensued.  

In an effort to balance the program by attempting to cover the major areas of current interest and also 
to maximize the number of people participating in the conference, many very good papers had to be 
rejected.  In the end, out of 153 submissions received, we could only accept 55.  I regret to inform you 
that your paper,

  Tree Path Labeling of Path Hypergraphs – A Generalization of the Consecutive Ones Property

was not one of those accepted.

Time constraints did not permit referees to make extensive comments on each paper. If comments were 
made that we believe would be beneficial to the authors, they will be sent in the coming days.

On behalf of the Program Committee I would like to thank you for your submission to and support of 
LATIN.

Sincerely,

-- David Fernández-Baca
   LATIN 2012 Program Chair
