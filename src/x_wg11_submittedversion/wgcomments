1st line of section 2: are there any indices i \in I such that U \setminus S_i \ne \emptyset or S_i = \emptyset?
1st paragraph on page 3: the symbol \preccurlyeq indicates a transitive, reflexive and antisymmetric relation. In which way does mub(X) represent a maximal upper bound? What about m=q in the definition of maximal upper bound? What is the difference between a maximal upper bound and a maximal element?
page 7: Here \preccurlyeq is reflexive, contradicting the "either - or" in Lemma 6. By the way, you could write M_i \preccurlyeq M_j instead of (M_i,M_j) \in \preccurlyeq.

The isomorphism completeness of path graphs has been known
for nearly as long as the isomorphism completeness of chordal graphs
[1]. In particular, a slight modification to the construction used in [1]
 shows that the class of split \cap path graphs is isomorphism complete
(i.e., after subdividing each edge, we make the ``new'' vertices into a
clique as opposed to the original vertices). For a more direct reference
the isomorphism completeness of directed path graphs can be used [2].

** The use of overlap components as a way to ``divide'' the testing
of the consecutive ones property into subproblems was first discussed
by Fulkerson and Gross [3]. They showed that a set family F has the
consecutive ones property iff the connected components of its overlap
graph have the consecutive ones property.

The paper states simple properties and direct extensions of Mc-Connell overlap
class structures [McC04] applied to tree paths instead of a unique path as in the
case of C1P. The decomposition used in section 5 is that of the overlap graph,
decomposed in connected component as in [Mc04] (precisely using 
Dahlhaus's algorithm, might
be cited). Each of these component is then treated separately to test a path-model
using already existing algorithms.



************ 
corneil quesitons the completeness...
TRY OTHER REDUCTIONS

************
(matrix decomposition) and it apparently also is from mcconnel- i doubt the second part..
CHECK THIS
  
************
try this business for 3 leaf trees, and would it be in logspace, and does an mcconnel kind of result hold? can you explore this..
       -- use the idea of slots from kklv10

************
 a. sloppy writing  
 can you seem fulkerson gross, hsu, etc..and see what notation they use... and standardize our work
use KKLV10- notation
-- Standardize the notation to kklv10: sec 2.1, sec 2.2 (para 2, 3)
      -- define tree path labellings analogous to interval labelling and restate the problem as in kklv10

-- Lemma: the number of tree path labellings of (\cF, T) is equal to zero or number of automorphisms of T. Prove this.
