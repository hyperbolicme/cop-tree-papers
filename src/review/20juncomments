a. the first part is fine..it has gone to WG and you have incorporated kklv's notation
b. it is the new stuff with respect to the star-
b1. check in standard graph theory what this star is called
b2. outline the approach
b3. mention that we saturate the "arms" or "rays" without touching the root. partial labeling
b4. after b3, we are left an assignment and a "remaining" set system which is of two types - 
type1: a set is either strictly contained in all those that are assigned or disjoint from all those that are assigned (do you see slot)  type 1 can be defined from kklv
type 2: when assigned it would touch the root (type 2 is waht needs to be formalized) we need to give a name

c. so now how do we complete the partial labeling
for each arm assign one set of b4 type 2
of course this cannot be completed as it could go into another arm and we do not know which
so to handle b4 type 2: we come up with a paritial assignment of b4 type 2 in each arm upto the root of the star

d.at the end of this step (after doing so for each arm), we "KNOW THE UNIVERSE OF OUR SET SYSTEM ASSOCIATED WITH EACH ARM"  
finally, take each pair of arms.
you know the sub-universe of the set system associated with the arm.
********** ????? take all the hyperedges in that sub-universe - assign it to the path formed by the two arms by checking for icpia. check for icpia on that path


e. also, 3 mutually intersecting paths such that one is not contained in the union of the other 2 will have to intersect at the root of the tree alone
   
f. just put this flowchart in first..
and then make connnections to concepts already there in kklv  
and then..put in new formalism we need


Algorithm
1) modularize 

2) top level flowchart - ---- with pointers to modules   
each module must be kutti and logical single unit

{\em Slots} are sets of elements in the universe $supp(\cF)$ which either
appear together in a set or do not appear in a set at all (as defined
in \cite{kklv10}).  \rcomment{mention partative family connection?}
\rcomment{Define ``slot'' in prelim sec}
If $T$ is a three leaved tree, it is clear that there is exactly one vertex $r$ in $T$ that has
degree $d(r) = 3$.\rfootnote{unexplored: Which is the set(s) that
  maps to a path(s) that has $r$?} In \cite{kklv10} they find the two {\em
  side slots} by identifying the two {\em maximum marginal} sets from $\cF$ (or
hyperedge from hypergraph $\cH$ in their set up). \rcomment{define
  ``marginal'', ``side slot'' in prelim or here.} Using this side slot
a partial order is defined that in their case (intervals) totally
orders $supp(\cF)$. From this it is easy to derive the 
the interval isomorphism and labeling.\\

\noindent
Calculate the slots in $supp(\cF)$ and let them be $Y_1, Y_2 ... Y_k$,
$k \in \mathbb{N}$.

\rcomment{Define ``marginal slot'' for a set in the system. How do we
  find it? 
}
\begin{lemma}
  If a set $S \in \cF$ has three marginal slots and if $v$ is the
  unique vertex in a three leaved tree $T$ such that $d(v) = 3$, $S$
  contains the element mapped to $v$ by a feasible tree path labeling
  if one exists. i.e. $\cl^{-1}(v) \in S$ where $\cl$ is a feasible
  tree path labeling. If such a labeling cannot be found, there does
  not exist a feasible tree path labeling for $\cF$ from $T$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
  \rcomment{TBD}
\end{proof}

\noindent
There will be exactly
three end slots if $\cF$ has a TPL to $T$. For each slot $Y_i, i \in
[k]$, do the following till a solution is found. Assume $Y = Y_i$ is
an end slot. Define the following partial order $\preccurlyeq_Y$ on $supp(\cF)$
\begin{enumerate}
\item if $u \in Y$ and $v \notin Y$ then $u \preccurlyeq_Y v$
\item if $u, v \in S$, where $S \in \cF$, then for every $w \notin S$,
  if $u \preccurlyeq_Y w$ then $v \preccurlyeq_Y w$ or if $w \preccurlyeq_Y u$ then $w \preccurlyeq_Y v$
\end{enumerate}

This is clearly a partial order since it is reflexive, antisymmetric and
transitive 
\rcomment{prove?}.

\begin{theorem}
  Let the Hasse diagram of the partial order $\preccurlyeq_Y$ defined
  above be $H_{\preccurlyeq_Y}$. Then if $T$ is a subgraph of
  $H_{\preccurlyeq_Y}$, there exists a TPL to $\cF$ from $T$.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
 \qed
\end{proof}

\rfootnote{tried first/unexplored:
  let slot that gets
assigned to the path with $r$ be $Y_r$. If $T_i$ is rooted at $r$ we
have exactly three paths from $r$ to the three leaves which are vertex
disjoint except at $r$. -- but it is not straightforward to find this
special slot. end slots are easier to find see kklv10.}  
\rfootnote{tried: There will be three marginal sets and three end slots. pick one at
random. Let it be $Y = Y_i, i \in [k]$
Use the partial ordering idea in \cite{kklv10} (page 10 para 1)
$\le_{Y}$. However in this case it will not be a total order. 
Assign paths as in pg 10 eq (3). \\
Finding $Y$ involves something similar to the marginal hyperedge
idea in \cite{kklv10}.}
